## 🅿️ Smart Car Parking System using Arduino

A **smart car parking system** built using Arduino UNO, IR sensors, LCD I2C display, and a servo motor. This system monitors slot availability and controls a gate barrier automatically when a vehicle enters or exits.

### 🖥️ Features

* 🚘 Detects filled and empty parking slots in real time
* 🪪 Displays status of 6 slots on LCD (S1–S6)
* 🧠 Automatically opens/closes gate via servo motor
* 🔄 Entry only when a slot is available
* 🧾 Simulation available in Proteus

---

### 🧠 How It Works

1. Each parking slot is monitored by an IR sensor.
2. Entry and exit IR sensors track incoming/outgoing cars.
3. LCD displays:

   * Total available slots
   * Status of each individual slot
4. If a car approaches and space is available:

   * Servo opens the gate
   * Slot count decreases
5. When a car exits:

   * Servo opens again
   * Slot count increases

### 📁 Required Arduino Libraries

1. **Servo**

   * Already included in Arduino IDE
   * Used to control the gate motor

2. **LiquidCrystal\_I2C**

   * For I2C 16x2 LCD display
   * Install via Library Manager → Search `LiquidCrystal I2C` by Frank de Brabander or similar

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Connect IR sensors, servo motor, and LCD I2C module as per circuit diagram.
2. Upload `Car_Parking_System_LCD.ino` to Arduino UNO.
3. Select correct board and port in Arduino IDE:

   ```
   Tools → Board → Arduino UNO  
   Tools → Port → [Your Port]
   ```
4. Click `Upload`
5. Power the Arduino via adapter for real-time use.
